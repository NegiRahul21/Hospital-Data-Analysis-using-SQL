# Hospital-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing hospital records using SQL. It demonstrates how to design a relational database, store hospital information, and write SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

# The project includes:
- Database creation (Hospital)
- Table design (Hospital_records) with attributes like hospital name, location, department, doctors, patients, admission/discharge dates, and medical expenses
- SQL queries to answer real-world business questions, such as:
- Total patients per hospital
- Average number of doctors
- Top departments by patient volume
- Hospital with maximum expenses
- Daily average expenses per patient
- Longest hospital stay
- City-wise patient distribution
- Average length of stay per department
- Department with lowest patients
- Monthly medical expenses

# SQL Queries Covered
- Total number of patients per hospital
- Average doctors per hospital
- Top 3 departments with highest patients
- Hospital with maximum expenses
- Daily average medical expenses
- Longest hospital stay
- Total patients treated per city
- Average stay length per department
- Department with lowest patients
- Monthly expense report

# Learning Outcomes
- Database creation & schema design
- Writing complex SQL aggregate queries
